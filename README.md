**HH Parser** is a command-line Python program designed to log into [hh.uz](https://hh.uz) (HeadHunter Uzbekistan) using user credentials, handle captchas, scrape job vacancy data based on user-specified criteria, and export the results to a `.csv` file.

## üìå Features

- **Terminal-Based Interface**: Fully operable via command-line inputs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**:
  - `selenium` (for browser automation and captcha handling)
  - `requests` (for downloading captcha images)
  - `pandas` (for CSV data handling)
  - `Pillow` (for image processing)
  - `urllib.parse` (for URL encoding)
- **Browser Driver**: Chrome WebDriver compatible with the installed Chrome browser version.
- **Optional Tools**:
  - A stable internet connection to handle web requests and captchas.
  - Environment variable support for secure password storage (e.g., `HH_PASSWORD`).

2. If a captcha is required, it downloads and displays the captcha image for manual solving.

4. It scrapes job details (title, company, experience, email, phone, link) from up to 2 pages (configurable).
5. Results are saved to a CSV file named after the sanitized job query (e.g., `Python_Developer.csv`).
